Data Description
Number of Instances(row): 306
Number of Attributes(column): 4
Attribute Information:
1. Age of patient at time of operation.
2. Patient’s year of operation (year — 1900)
3. Number of positive axillary nodes detected
4. Survival status (class attribute) 1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer. 2 = the patient died within 5 year
Objective:
1.Exploratory data analysis on Haberman’s Dataset for predicting and analysing the data regarding the survival of patients who had undergone breast cancer treatment between 1958 and 1970 based on following data Attribute.
* Age : Analysis the common age range where Patient diagnose breast cancer.
* Year Of Operation : Year when Patient undergone breast cancer treatment.
* Number Of Positive Axillary Node : A lymph node in the area of the armpit
(axilla) to which cancer has spread. This spread is determined by surgically removing some of the lymph nodes and examining them under a microscope to see whether cancer cells are present. source: https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/positive-axillary-lymph-node?redirect=true
* Survival Status: (1) patient survived 5 years or longer.
(2) patient died within 5 years. Assuming:If patient has survived 5 year or more ,class attribute = “yes” ,If patient died within 5 years ,class attribute =“no”.
2. Visualization; its help us to analyse and reason about data and evidence. So we can makes complex data more accessible, understandable and usable.
